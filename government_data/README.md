This folder contains government data pulled from Oxford's [Government Response Tracker] (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). We focus our analysis on the Stringency Index, which measures the relative stringency of governments' policies which link to limiting social contact and promoting social distancing.
