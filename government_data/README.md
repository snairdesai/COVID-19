This folder contains government data pulled from Oxford's [Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). We focus our analysis on the [Stringency Index](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker), which measures the relative stringency of governments' policies which link to limiting social contact and promoting social distancing.
