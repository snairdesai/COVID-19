This folder contains distance and locational data on the sample from [CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/bdd.asp). Note this data is not incorporated in the first round of analysis. The data for the distance file is recorded as paired dyads (every nation in the world is matched to every other nation in the world). Shared characteristics are then coded in each column (i.e. similar language; similar colonial heritage etc.), as well as the distance of the each nation in the dyad from one another. The data for the geo_distance file records additional geographical information including surface area, whether a nation is landlocked, the continent and major cities of the nation; and the cultural heritage of each nation (language, and colonizer).
